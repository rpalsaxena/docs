This page lists the workspace secrets you need to add before using Agent Builder. Add these in your LangSmith workspace settings under Secrets. Keep values scoped to your workspace and avoid placing credentials in prompts or code.

## Workspace vs personal agents

Agent Builder supports two visibility modes:

- Personal agents: private to the creator. Useful for personal workflows and experiments. These use your user identity and user‑scoped tool authorizations.
- Workspace agents: shared within the [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces). Good for team workflows. These use workspace‑scoped configuration and can run with team‑managed secrets.

### Differences

- Ownership and access: personal agents are only visible to you; workspace agents are visible to permitted users in the workspace.
- Tool auth: both modes support OAuth and secret‑based tools. Personal agents typically use user tokens; workspace agents can use workspace‑managed app auth where appropriate.
- Secrets: use workspace secrets for API keys in both modes. Avoid putting credentials in prompts or code.

## How to add workspace secrets

In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), ensure that your Anthropic API key is set as a [workspace secret](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspace-secrets).

1. Navigate to <Icon icon="gear" /> **Settings** and then move to the **Secrets** tab.
1. Select **Add secret** and enter the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and your API key as the **Value**.
1. Select **Save secret**.

<Note> When adding workspace secrets in the LangSmith UI, make sure the secret keys match the environment variable names expected by your model provider.</Note>

## Required model key

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Required for Agent Builder models. The agent graphs load this key from workspace secrets for inference.

  Agent Builder supports custom models. You can override the default Anthropic model by providing a different `modelId` and a matching secret name via `envVarName` (see "Custom models" for examples). Secrets prefixed with `AGENT_BUILDER_` are prioritized.

## Optional tool keys

Add keys for any tools you enable. These are read from workspace secrets at runtime.

- `EXA_API_KEY`: Required for Exa search tools (general web and LinkedIn profile search).
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Required for Tavily web search.
- `TWITTER_API_KEY` and `TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET`: Required for Twitter/X read operations (app‑only bearer). Posting/media upload is not enabled.

## MCP server configuration

Agent Builder can pull tools from one or more remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers. Configure MCP servers and headers in your [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) settings. Agent Builder automatically discovers tools and applies the configured headers when calling them.

For more details on using the remote MCP servers, refer to the the [MCP Framework](/langsmith/agent-builder-mcp-framework#using-remote-mcp-servers) page.
