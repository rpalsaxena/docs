title: LangGraph integrations
---

LangGraph integrates with a growing ecosystem of tools and protocols that help you connect your agents to user interfaces, standardize agent definitions, and build production-ready applications. LangGraph integrations span two categories:

- [Front-end integrations](#front-end-integrations) — Connect LangGraph agents to user interfaces
- [Standards and interoperability](#standards-and-interoperability) — Portable agent definitions across runtimes

## Front-end integrations

Front-end integrations provide a lightweight bridge between LangGraph and user interfaces, allowing you to connect your agents to user interfaces with streaming state updates and human-in-the-loop support.
